# Fullstack Real Estate NFT Marketplace NftyHomes on Ethereum using Polygon, Nextjs, Wagmi and RainbowKit

This project is to demonstrate how to build a Fullstack application using Polygon and Nextjs with Wagmi and Rainbowkit as Wallet Connection Manager. It would also demonstrate how to style the frontend using Chakra-UI. You could actually make use of any styling library of your choice but I have recently come to like building with Chakra but TailwindCSS is also a great library you could use. 
The choice of Polygon is for lower gas.
